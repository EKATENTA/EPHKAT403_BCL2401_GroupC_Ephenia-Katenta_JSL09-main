# [JSL09] Submission: Personal Dashboard Chrome Extension


## Overview of the Project
The Promise Rejection Dashboard Challenge is an interactive web-based project focused on creating a Chrome Dashboard extension. This project is hosted on Scrimba and will be uploaded to the Module 09 GitHub repository.

## What I Included
I cloned the provided Starter Code Repository to my local development environment from GitHub.
I downloaded the personalized Scrimba files from the zip folder and placed them in the cloned GitHub repository.
I opened the cloned project in my code editor and coded solutions for each challenge as per the instructions, ensuring to add customizations where necessary.

## Challenges
I encountered various technical challenges while implementing the requirements of the project, such as integrating the Chrome Dashboard extension and ensuring compatibility across different browsers.Managing the workflow of downloading, modifying, and uploading files posed some challenges, particularly in ensuring that changes were accurately reflected in the GitHub repository.

## Areas of Improvement
Streamlining Workflow: Finding ways to streamline the workflow of downloading Scrimba files, making modifications, and pushing changes to GitHub could improve efficiency and reduce the likelihood of errors.
Enhancing User Experience: Exploring additional features or enhancements for the Chrome Dashboard extension could further improve the user experience and functionality.

## Overall Learning
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in:
Working with Chrome Dashboard extensions.
Collaborating with version control systems like Git and GitHub.
Problem-solving and troubleshooting technical issues.
Adhering to project requirements and meeting deadlines.
